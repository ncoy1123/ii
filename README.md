# The Introduction

- Don't rely on charts to make decisions.
- Buying when the stock has been going up and selling when it's going down is the opposite of what you want. **Buy low, sell high.**

### Types of Investors
1. **Defensive Investor**: This approach involves passive investing and a slower pace. These investors prefer to be in the market for the long term.
2. **Enterprising Investor**: This type of investor actively trades to try to beat the market. It requires much more work and carries higher risk. Professionals don't see everything, and articles tend to follow recent or daily news rather than long-term trends.

### Avoiding Losses
- It's crucial to avoid significant losses in investments. For instance, a **95% loss** requires a **1900% gain** just to break even. Similarly, a **50% loss** needs a **100% gain**, and a **25% loss** needs a **33% gain**. A **33% loss** requires a **50% gain**.

### Bear Market Perspective
- A bear market should be viewed as stocks going on sale. This means that during a bear market, many stocks are available at lower prices, presenting opportunities for investors.

### Growth vs. Value Stocks
- **Growth stocks** are more uncertain as they are expected to grow rapidly, leading to higher volatility.
- On the other hand, **value stocks** can be less risky because they are established companies with strong fundamentals, and their stocks are available at reasonable prices. They are generally good stocks at a good price.

# Chapter 1 – Investment VS Speculation

### **Investing vs. Speculation:** 
Investing involves carefully analyzing assets, considering their potential for adequate returns, and making informed decisions based on fundamental analysis. The goal is to build wealth over the long term. Speculation, on the other hand, typically involves making high-risk bets without thorough analysis, often driven by short-term price movements or market sentiment.
    
### **Value Investing:**
Value investors focus on finding undervalued assets, such as stocks, that they believe the market has mispriced. While value investing is generally considered less speculative, no investment is entirely risk-free. It's essential to exercise caution and avoid excessive speculation even within value investing strategies.
    
### **Long-Term Perspective:** 
The best approach to investing is to adopt a long-term perspective. Short-term price fluctuations are common and can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, economic conditions, and news events. Being too fixated on daily stock prices can lead to emotional decision-making and potentially harm your overall investment strategy.
    
### **Beware of Gimmicks:**
It's essential to be cautious about following market gimmicks or trends that promise quick profits. As you mentioned, these strategies often lose effectiveness as more people adopt them, leading to increased risk and potential losses.
    
### **Active vs. Passive Investing:** 
Active investing involves actively managing a portfolio, often with frequent buying and selling based on market movements or opportunities. Passive investing, on the other hand, involves holding a diversified portfolio for the long term, typically through low-cost index funds. Both approaches have their merits, and the choice depends on your risk tolerance, time horizon, and investment goals. 
Driving the analogy of the car, you can drive 130mph to get somewhere twice as fast as 60mph. Just because you drove 130mph, and it was ok once, it doesn't mean it's safe to do. Actions like this will get you killed or destroy your portfolio.

# Chapter 2 -The Investor and inflation

### Stocks' Performance Against Inflation
When combating inflation, stocks tend to be more desirable than bonds. Inflation, which averages around 2.5%, erodes a significant portion, if not more than half, of the income from bonds.

Stocks, however, are not a one-size-fits-all solution.  The amount that businesses earn and stocks doesn't follow inflation, and seems to be at a pretty stable 3.5% in dividends and 4% in stock growth. These real examples also show this
- **Negative Inflation:** During times of negative inflation, stocks experienced a sharp decline of 46%.
- **High Inflation:** Similarly, when inflation soared to 6%, stocks also performed poorly.

Historical data suggests that over 50 out of 64 five-year periods, stocks have managed to outpace inflation, making them a potentially attractive choice for investors seeking protection against inflation.

### Gold as a Safe Investment?
Gold is often viewed as a safe investment due to its tangible nature. However, it may not be as effective against inflation as one might think. Gold's growth is slow and gold prices can fluctuate similar to stock, adding an element of risk to this investment. Additionally, there are other costs associated with investing in gold, such as storage and potential insurance for damages.

This does not mean that Gold or Bonds are bad for investing, just that they don't do as well as stocks, and they are important for diversification

### The Impact of Inflation on Perceived Value
Inflation can have a psychological impact on how we perceive our financial situation:
- With a 2% pay increase and 4% inflation, people may still feel relatively good about their financial status.
- However, with a 2% pay increase and 0% inflation, people might feel terrible, even though the real value of their money remains the same.

# Chapter 3 -A Century of Stock market History 

## The Importance of Knowing Stock Market History
Understanding the history of the stock market is crucial for evaluating your position's risk and identifying the best times to invest. It provides insights into the cycles the stock market goes through and showcases historical returns.

### Historical Crashes and Returns
Observing graphs of historic crashes reveals that they tend to result in around a 30% decline. On the positive side, stocks have historically shown an upward trend, with only 2 out of the last 10 decades experiencing negative growth. However, it's essential to remember that past performance does not guarantee future results. It's worth noting that economic recessions have occurred on average about once every 6 years.

### Graham's Insight in 1970
In 1970, the book by Graham suggests that the great boom era might have come to an end. Despite this, stock performance has remained relatively consistent. Which helps show the difficulty in predicting the markets.

### Stocks and Worthiness
Graham emphasizes that just because stocks tend to show an upward trajectory, it doesn't mean they are always worth buying. Warren Buffett, who was a student of Graham, disagrees with this viewpoint. While Graham's theory holds for individual stocks, studies have shown that dollar cost averaging yields better long-term results compared to attempting to time the market.

### The Price Entry Point
One interesting aspect is that the price at which you enter the market does not affect the eventual outcome. Whether you buy a stock before or after a 20% drop, if it goes up 50% in a year, you will be up 50% from where you currently are.


# Chapter 4 - portfolio policy for Defensive investor
### Passive vs. Active Investing
If you're a risk-averse investor, you'll have to accept lower returns. Passive investors prioritize safety and freedom from concerns, while active investors aim for higher potential earnings. However, active investing demands more time and carries higher risks.

### Stock Allocation for Defensive Investors
Defensive investors should allocate between 25% and 75% of their portfolio to stocks. Adjustments can be made based on market conditions. In uncertain or high markets, reducing stock allocation to around 25% is prudent, and vice versa. Another straightforward strategy the defensive investors can try is having  a 50/50 allocation between stocks and other assets. During market crashes, you can buy discounted stocks, and during bullish periods, you can sell some to manage overexposure. This strategy has its merits, although it's not necessarily the optimal approach.
It is not possible to tell the best strategy for defensive investing, and an example is Yale University studies. Originally advocating Yale for 35% stock, it later changed to 61%. This highlights the evolving nature of allocation recommendations.

## Bond Decision and Tax Considerations
##### Tax-Adjusted Bond Yield Assessment
In bond decisions, arithmetic is pivotal. Assess the advantage of extra yield after taxes. Tax brackets play a role in determining whether higher-yield taxed bonds are truly advantageous. Lower-quality, higher-yield bonds are risky and should be avoided.

##### Opting for Longer-Term Bonds
Graham advises selecting longer-term (20-25 year) bonds to prevent bond calls and maintain stability in the bond portion of the portfolio.

## Tailoring Investment Aggressiveness
#### Aligning Investment Strategy with Investor Type
Investment aggressiveness should align with the investor's profile rather than just their holdings. The traditional approach of being aggressive in youth and conservative in old age is being personalized. Consider life events and financial goals.

##### Personal Factors Influencing Risk Tolerance
Even if age suggests aggressiveness, personal circumstances matter. Young individuals planning significant expenses like weddings or buying a should avoid excessive risks even though traditionally they should be more risky. Older individuals with substantial savings can tolerate more risk which again is the opposite of  traditional beliefs.

##### Rare Cases of 100% Stock Allocation
A minority may invest fully in stocks, but this is uncommon. It demands strong nerves, an emergency fund, and unwavering long-term commitment. Yet, even for such investors, a 100% stock allocation might not always be appropriate.

## Tax-Free Bonds and Retirement Accounts

### Strategic Bond Purchases

Preference for tax-free bonds is advisable, except within retirement accounts. In retirement accounts the tax doesn't matter and taxed bonds offer a higher yield

# Chapter 5 - The defensive investor and Common stock
### Lengthy Recovery from Historic Crashes
Stock market crashes can lead to extended recovery periods. A case in point is the crash of 1929, which took over 25 years to regain its pre-crash level. During that era, stocks grew at a slower rate compared to today though at around 3.1%.

### Dividend Benefits in Stock Investment
Stocks offer the advantage of dividends, which contribute significantly to long-term returns. For instance, a $1 investment in 1900 would have grown to $198 by 2000 without reinvesting dividends. However, reinvesting dividends would have resulted in an impressive $16,798.

## Key Criteria for Stock Selection
### Choosing Stocks Wisely
When selecting stocks, focus on larger companies that meet specific criteria for solid investment choices. These criteria include:

1. **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Target stocks with an EPS of no more than 25 times per share. This indicates a reasonable valuation level.
2. **Price to earning ratio(P/E)**: P/E is taking the EPS which shows growth and divides it by the stock price to find the value of the stock. 10-20 is a good P/E
3. **Diversification**: Aim for a minimum of 10 stocks in your portfolio to ensure diversification and reduce risk.

### Growth Stocks and Their Risks
#### Understanding Growth Stocks
Growth stocks are companies with anticipated doubling of EPS within a decade. However, these stocks often come with elevated prices relative to their current earnings.

#### Vulnerability of Growth Stocks
Growth stocks are susceptible to market fluctuations and crashes due to their high valuation. Their performance can be volatile in challenging market conditions.

## The Power of Dollar Cost Averaging
### Superiority of Dollar Cost Averaging

Dollar cost averaging proves to be a potent investment strategy compared to trying to time the market. This approach offers consistent returns by:

1. **Buying in Dips**: Allowing investors to buy more shares at lower costs during market downturns.
2. **Continuous Investment**: Enabling investors to continue investing as prices rise.

### Historical Example: The Great Depression
Demonstrating the effectiveness of dollar cost averaging, consider the Great Depression era. Investing $12,000 in September 1929 would have left you with $7,223 after a decade. In contrast, investing $100 monthly during the same period would have grown to $15,572.

## Lessons in Independent Research and Professional Fallibility
### The Importance of Personal Research
This chapter underscores the necessity of conducting your own research. Even professionals can be mistaken, as highlighted by instances earlier in the book where Graham's perspectives were proven wrong. The commenter also mentioned in how people buying Amazon emotionally was a bad idea, which we know now buying Amazon then would have been good.


# Chapter 6 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising investor - The negative side

### Building a Foundation with Bonds and Value Stocks
An enterprising investor's strategy should commence similarly to a defensive investor's approach, involving a balanced portfolio of bonds and well-priced value stocks.

### Pitfalls of Second Grade Bonds and Priority Stocks
**Second Grade (Junk) Bonds** and **Priority Stocks** can face significant challenges during market downturns, leading to substantial declines. Their inherently higher risk nature makes them vulnerable in turbulent markets.

### Caution with International Bonds
**International Bonds** have experienced historical turmoil since 1914 due to global conflicts and economic depressions. This history highlights the potential risks associated with international bond investments.

### Perils of New Issues
**New Issues** can pose considerable dangers for investors. They often debut during favorable market conditions and brokers may promote them more aggressively due to higher margins. This can lead to investments in potentially unsafe assets.

## Recognizing Bull Market Indicators
##### Influx of IPOs in Bull Markets
During bull markets, Initial Public Offerings (**IPOs**) tend to surge. For instance, in 1962, there were 850 IPOs, and in 1979, there were 781. This phenomenon signals a thriving market.

##### Red Flags of Bull Market Conclusion
An indicator of a bull market's impending end is when newly launched companies start being valued higher than well-established firms. Subsequently, newer IPOs may experience a drastic 75% drop.

## The Impact of Trading Frequency
Engaging in excessive trading or day trading can erode returns. The focus on short-term gains triggers short-term capital gains tax, rather than the more favorable long-term capital gains tax. Additionally, trading fees can further reduce profitability. It can also add a lot of transaction or commission costs.

# Chapter 7 - Portfolio Policy for the Enterprising investor - The positive side
### Favorable Bonds: Tax-Free Industrial Municipal Bonds
Consider tax-free industrial bonds issued by municipalities as potential sound bond investments.

### Challenges of Timing the Evolving Market
Market timing, once simpler, is now complicated due to ever-changing market conditions. The values for buying or selling are in a state of constant flux and are continually rising.

## Navigating Growth Stocks
##### Characteristics of Growth Stocks
Growth stocks are those that have outpaced the market's growth and are anticipated to continue this trend. While these stocks seem promising, they often come at a higher price due to their anticipated success.

##### The Dilemma of Pricing for Growth Stocks
The elevated pricing of growth stocks can reduce their attractiveness. If their growth rate slows down, they may already be overpriced, making them less likely to provide a good return.

##### Performance of Growth Stocks in Index Funds
Analysis reveals that growth stocks within growth index funds tend to perform similarly to the overall market.

## Strategies for the Enterprising Investor
#### Setting a Distinctive Investment Plan
To be a successful enterprising investor, you need a well-defined plan and a unique approach that differentiates you from other investors. If you don't do anything unique, then you will get average or market returns

#### Identifying Value in Unpopular Stocks
Successful companies are often overvalued, leaving lesser-known companies in the industry being undervalued  as potential opportunities for enterprising investors.

### Seeking Opportunities in Unpopular Stocks
An enterprising investor's task involves identifying companies that are starting to perform well or finding hidden gems among unpopular stocks.

### Criteria for Bargain Stocks
Investing in bargain stocks demands careful selection. These stocks should either be currently underperforming or unpopular, and have the potential to rebound. Stability in the company's history is also crucial.

### The Pitfalls of Troubled Companies
Companies facing lawsuits or accounting issues may seem like bargain opportunities due to undervaluation. However, such situations are risky, as they could lead to significant losses.


#  Chapter 8 - The investor and market fluctuations 
### Profiting from Price Fluctuations
Market fluctuations can offer opportunities for profit, particularly in terms of pricing. The focus here is on purchasing undervalued stocks and holding onto them until they become overvalued.

### The Distinction Between Pricing and Timing
Distinguishing between pricing and timing is crucial. While pricing refers to buying low and selling high, timing involves attempting to predict market movements – a much more challenging endeavor.

### The Infeasibility of Perfect Timing
Attempting to perfectly time the market is virtually impossible. Even avoiding the five worst days of the year would be extremely challenging and often impractical. If you held $1 continually from 1966 to 2001 you would then have $40. If you got out of market right before the 5 worst days of the year you would have $980. Research from Duke University revealed that even following the top 10% of market timing advice between 1991-1995 yielded lower returns (12.6%) compared to simply investing in a stock market index fund (16.4%).

### Evolving Effectiveness of Strategies
Strategies change over time as market conditions and popularity shift. Buy low, sell high strategies, though effective historically, are less reliable today due to the unpredictability of market trends.

### Limitations of Simple Formula Plans
Simple formula plans, like selling after a certain price increase or buying after a price drop, face the same pitfalls as the buy low, sell high approach. These strategies don't always yield optimal results in today's complex market environment.

## Embracing Market Fluctuations
##### Riding the Ups and Downs
Market fluctuations are a natural part of investing. Most stocks will experience a 30% decrease from their peak within five years, but also a 50% increase from their lowest point.

##### Understanding Mr. Market
View market fluctuations as Mr. Market's behavior. He offers prices influenced by emotions and news, which can result in irrational valuations. Learning not to worry about these often erratic valuations is key.

### A Long-Term Horizon
For a long-term horizon of 25 or 30 years, consistent investment in a stock market index fund is a rational approach. Regular monthly contributions should be complemented by selling only when cash is needed.


# Chapter 9 - Investing in Investment Funds
### The Role of Funds
Funds provide an easier approach to saving and investing compared to the complexities of picking individual stocks. They offer a simple way to match the market or sector, providing diversification across multiple stocks.

### Benefits of Index Funds
Index funds are a cost-effective means of diversification, mirroring market or sector performance. On average, individuals investing in index funds outperform those directly investing in stocks.

### The Rise of Performance Funds
Performance funds, aiming to outperform the market, have gained popularity. Typically led by young traders with promising starts, these funds employ riskier strategies. However, they often face difficulties over time.

## Challenges and Dynamics of Performance Funds
##### The Pitfalls of Success
When performance funds excel, more investors enter, affecting their performance. The influx of new capital can hinder growth if not properly invested.
##### Managing Performance Funds
Decisions of whether to invest new capital in existing or new stocks present challenges. Investing in existing stocks might lead to overvaluation, while new stocks may indicate a lack of initial confidence.
##### Managed Fund Drawbacks
Managed funds like performance funds carry higher operating costs that can diminish overall growth.

## Index Funds: A Steady but Effective Choice
##### The Advantages of Index Funds
The primary drawback of index funds is their perceived lack of excitement. Yet, they offer consistent, long-term performance with minimal operating costs.

## Traits of Market-Beating Mutual Funds
Mutual funds that outperform the market share common characteristics. Managers being significant shareholders ensures a vested interest in the fund's success, preventing self-serving actions.
##### 1. Emphasizing Low Costs
Low-cost funds are crucial for preserving profits over time, as high costs erode gains. another thing is costs remain consistent while performance and risk fluctuate.
##### 2. Differentiating from the Index
Funds that differ substantially from market indices have a better chance of outperforming. Otherwise, matching index performance would be equivalent to investing in an index fund.
##### 3. Avoiding the Glare of Publicity
Successful funds often refrain from advertising, aligning with Plato's idea that effective rulers don't seek power.
##### 4. Managerial History
Examining the fund manager's track record provides insights into potential future performance.


# Chapter 10 - The investor and his advisors
### Relying on Expert Guidance
A significant percentage of investors, around 24%, turn to financial planners for assistance. An additional 17% seek advice from friends or spouses, while 16% rely on brokers. However, trustworthiness remains a crucial factor in seeking financial guidance, as professionals are not infallible.

### Evaluating Professionals' Credibility
Even financial professionals can make errors. A credible financial expert will make reasonable claims and prioritize capital preservation.

### Caution with Wall Street Brokers
Wall Street brokers can lean towards speculation, and older-style brokers might encourage frequent trading to increase their commissions.

### Understanding Qualifications
Brokers are required to pass an examination and be registered, but security analysts or financial analysts might lack these regulatory requirements.


## The Decision to Self-Manage or Seek Advice
### Managing Your Portfolio
It's entirely possible to manage your portfolio on your own. However, financial advisors can be beneficial for individuals facing significant losses, financial struggles, chaotic portfolios, or life-altering events.

### Ensuring Trustworthiness in Advisors
### Essential Trustworthiness
Trust is the foundation of financial advice. Verifying claims and the background of potential advisors is essential, especially given the potential for financial fraud.
### Thorough Verification
Use resources like the **AdvisorInfo** database on **sec.gov** to verify advisors' credentials before engaging with them.

## Choosing the Right Financial Advisor
### The Importance of Alignment
Selecting a trustworthy advisor is pivotal. The chosen advisor should align with your financial goals and personality. Conduct interviews to gauge compatibility.
### The Advisor's Responsibility
A reliable financial advisor should also assess the match between their expertise and your financial objectives.

# Chapter 11 - Security analysis for the lay investor: the general approach
### The Impact of Growth and Time
Stock valuations become less accurate as the estimated growth increases and the time horizon extends. Small changes in growth projections can lead to significant discrepancies in distant valuations.

## Evaluating Bond Investments
##### The Case for Bond Funds
For bond analysis, it's increasingly preferable to invest in bond funds due to the high cost of diversifying individual bonds which properly doing could cost upward of $100,000. Bond funds offer a convenient way to maintain diversified exposure without extensive research.
##### Criteria for Investment Grade Bonds
Investment grade bonds should possess earnings at least 4 or 5 times the minimum required for total fixed charges averaged over 7 years. The worst performing year should still have earnings at least 3 times the fixed charges.

## Valuing Stocks
##### Valuation Methodology for Stocks
The approach to valuing stocks involves estimating a company's average earnings over a few years and then comparing it to the stock price. This involves using the capitalization factor, which incorporates the company's long-term perspective and management quality.
##### Factoring in Management and Financial Strength
The role of management is critical, particularly when assessing new management. The financial strength of a company matters, and a cash surplus is more favorable than a company with similar price and earnings but reliant on bank loans.
##### The Significance of Dividends
Consistently paid dividends over an extended period are a positive factor. The dividend itself contributes to the overall valuation.
##### Formula for Evaluating Growth Stocks
A formula to value growth stocks is the current earnings multiplied by (8.5 + 2 times the expected annual growth rate).
